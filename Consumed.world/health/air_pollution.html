    <!--  INTRODUCTION ABOUT AIR POLLUTION  -->

    <div class="intro text">

    <h2>Number of deaths (per 100 000) due to pollution by country</h2>
    <p><br>The data of the graph below, who has been extracted from the OECD's website, <br>
    clearly shows how there are more deaths due to pollution in the <strong>bigger Asian countries and Eastern Europe.</strong></p>

    <p>In comparison, <strong>Western countries and Oceania</strong> show way better results.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Altogether, there is a -0.45 correlation between air pollution and the share of people being in good health; This means that higher air pollution tends to lead towards people being in worse health.</p>
    <p>This inverse correlation is not the strongest and should be seen as being part of an environment leading towards worse health.</p>

<!-- ASSUMPTIONS ON VISUALIZATION   -->

<div class="possibilities text">

<h4>There are multiple possible explanations: </h4>
<p><br>First, there is population density; <br> This might help understand China's and India's case, but Eastern Europe isn't that particularly dense. Therefore, we should think of density as being a boosting factor but not a cause.</p>
<p><br>What might make more sense is the level of industrialization, <br> with more developed countries showing less pollution than lagging countries.</p>
<p><br>Further, there is the population's mentality; <br> While Oceania and Western countries try to move towards 'greener consumption', poorer countries might tend to see it more as a luxury or have a different educational view.
  Also, as we can see it during the G20 meetings, countries such as China try to defend their 'right to pollute' since Western countries polluted without limits before the last decades.</p>
<p><br>Another thing that could strengthen this last assumption is that poorer populations would be more concerned about survival of their own, rather than survival of the planet (which is a more distant thought). </p>


<p>Many hypotheses are possible, and it probably is a mix of different reasons. <br> Unfortunately, I do not have the data or the knowledge yet to make clear assumptions. <br>My goal is to identify where the countries in trouble are in order to dig deeper and answer those assumptions later on. </p>
