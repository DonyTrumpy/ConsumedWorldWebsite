    <div class="life_expectancy long text">
      <h2>Let's talk about habits in consumption!</h2>
      <br>
      <h3>To start, we can discuss alcohol consumption:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>As we can see here below, Northern- and Western Europe absolutely love alcohol, while Eastern- and Southern Europe are less enthousiastic about this drug.</p>
      <p>The most alcoholic countries include: Finland, Norway, Denmark and Luxembourg.</p>
      <p>While the most sober countries include Italy, Greece and Spain. This surprised me since those countries include many "party" travel destinations, but I guess the locals themselves tend to be more reserved.</p>
      <p>Maybe it is time to let go the clich√© of the drunk Polish guy with his vodka.</p>
      <br>
      <p>What should be said, is how shocking the Norway's data looks; They have almost 85% of their population drinking heavily at least once per month! I hope this does not include children. Apparently there is 0% people drinking heavily less than once per month, which might point to an anomaly.</p>
      <p>Maybe this is the correct data, maybe there was a difference in collecting the data or maybe a typing error. The total percentages add up to 100% so I will be waiting for newer results to compare.</p>
      <p>In all cases, if Norway's government needs additional tax money, I believe we have here a pretty good revenue source.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Populations in which people drink heavily on a more frequent basis tend to show less cases of deaths because of diabetes (-0.52).</p>
      <p>This does not consider the number of people with diabetes, only the death toll. It might not actually be that heavy drinking cures diabetes, but rather a better healthcare system or other factors.</p>

<div class="life_expectancy_long long text">
  <h3>Eastern Europe's prefered drug:</h3>
  <p>As have just seen, Southern- and Eastern Europe were not that enthousiastic about alcohol, but this does not mean they do not have another drug at heart: cigarettes.</p>
  <p>Here, the table turns as we see Western- and Northern Europe being very limited smokers, while Southern- and Eastern Europe have about 20% their population smoking.</p>
  <p>When I say, the table turns, it is almost like a mirror; Countries that love to drink heavily tend not to smoke and the inverse is also true. Heavy smokers and heavy drinkers have a -0.58 correlation. Also, populations with a higher percentage of heavy smokers have a 0.65 correlation with never drinking.</p>

<!--  THE THIRD CAROUSEL NOW TAKES A LOOK AT FRUITS AND VEGIES' CONSUMPTION  -->

<div class="life_expectancy_long long text">
  <h3>Who actually follows the rule: 5 fruits and vegies a day keep the doctor away?</h3>
  <p>As we can see, Eastern- and Northern Europe have a large portion of their population not eating their fruits and vegetables. On top of the list
  we get: Latvia, Czech Republic, and Luxembourg.</p>
  <p>The 'better' countries here include Belgium, Spain and Ireland.</p>
  <br><br>
  <p>There are some interesting countries, such as the Netherlands,
    that have as many people eating all their fruits and vegetables as poeple only eating them partially. This larger share of 'eating all their fruits and vegies' explains how the Netherlands scores so poorly on 'eating 1 to 4 portions'.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are small correlations with eating its fruits and vegetables on the population scale such as: </p>
    <p>Smoking populations are inversely correlated with eating fruits and vegetables (-0.4).</p>
    <br>
    <p>The most note worthy correlation though is: Eating more fruits and vegetables is correlated with a healthier liver (0.52).</p>
